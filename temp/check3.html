<b>When, if ever, will HTML support template stamping</b>
<small>2024-02-25</small>

Template stamping, declarative custom elements, HTML components. Different names for the same concept: code reuse in plain HTML by applying templating rules.
Since 2007, this feature has been independently proposed 18 times (and that's likely not exhaustive).
In 2024, you still can't make a reusable component (&agrave; la React, Angular, etc.) without additional Javascript.
The Web Components standard is completely reliant on Javascript APIs.

Welcome to the war on HTML, a decade-long movement by web platforms, browser vendors and standards bodies to de-prioritise HTML and the open web.
I'm joking of course, what a silly conspiracy theory.

<u>Footnote 1: A different era</u>

Since the christening of HTML5, the featureset of HTML has shrunk considerably (no more font tags, frames, etc).
Many of those features, considered non-semantic and subpar UX at the time have been re-implemented in Javascript.
The web has largely moved on from a document-centric model to an application-centric model, and HTML is pass&eacute;.
Content has moved into walled-gardens on large platforms that increasingly lock down APIs to monetize LLM training.
In this sense, writing HTML is an act of rebellion, a counter-culture against a world that neglects the free and open dissemination of information.
